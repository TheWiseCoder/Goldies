### 1.2. src/streams

Collections of stream-related utilities, coded for both SICStus and SWI-Prolog.

### 1.3. src/sicstus

Collections of utilities, coded for the SICStus platform.

### 1.4. src/swi

## 2. DOCUMENTATION

An extensive documentation for the collection can be found in the *doc* folder, accessible by browser directly from *index.html*. It was produced with the  help of SWI-Prolog's *PlDoc Source Documentation System*, which extracts and organizes the documentation added to the source code, integrated with other documents.
